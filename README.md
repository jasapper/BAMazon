# BAMazon

BAMamazon! is a very straightforward console/commandline application version of everyone's favorite online behemeath, written is Node.ja. It is intended to show the customer shopping experience at its most basic levels. Browse the list of items for sale, select an item and quantity to purchase, and if enough items are in stock the sale is completed and order total shown, although no money or products are actually changing hands.

### Overview
There will be two "points-of-entry": as a typical cutomer or a store manager, the latter of which will have some administrative/management options available.

As this app is run through your terminal aka console the steps needed in order to successfully run the application may be different than what you are familiar with.

1. Install Node.js if not already present and have an available mySQL server.
2. Using Terminal change to the directory where the app has been placed and enter "npm install" to install the required dependencies automatically.
3. Decide which of the two "roles" you would like to work with and start the app using either "node [BAMamazonCutomer.js OR BAMamazonManager.js].
_For example to start the customer side enter "node BAMazonCustomer.js"_

ENJOY!
